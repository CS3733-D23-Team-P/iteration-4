                        This application is in collaboration with Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital and represents the
                        work of 10 WPI undergraduate students in partial fulfillment of the requirements for
                        CS3733-D23 Software Engineering.
                        As a whole, our group worked together effectively to communicate, apply Agile development
                        methodologies, and fulfill software requirements in Java. We shared ideas, provided
                        constructive feedback to each other, and took on different roles and responsibilities in
                        order to accomplish the objectives of the project.
                        The software systems we created were used to inform the hospital representatives about
                        potential features, user interfaces, or design approaches that they might consider
                        implementing.
